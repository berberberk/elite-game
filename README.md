# Stellar Voyager
***The galaxy is yours to conquerâ€¦ if you can outsmart it.***

### ðŸš€ Embark on an Infinite Odyssey

**Step into the boots of a daring space courier** in Stellar Voyager, a space adventure where **every jump could mean glory -- or doom**. The universe is procedurally generated, ensuring no two journeys are alike. With galaxies teeming with danger, mystery, and untold riches, your mission is simple: deliver cargo across the stars. But surviving the trip? Thatâ€™s where the real challenge begins.

## ðŸŒŸ Features That Define Your Journey

### ðŸŒŒ Procedurally Generated Peril

**Explore an ever-changing universe of planets**, each with unique ecosystems, resources, and threats. From lush alien jungles to barren ice-worlds haunted by cosmic storms, every planet is a gambleâ€”and every gamble could cost you everything.

### â›½ Fuel or Fail

**Every hyper-jump drains precious fuel.** Plot your route wisely: take shortcuts through pirate-infested nebulae, or play it safe and risk running dry in the void. One wrong calculation, and youâ€™ll drift eternally among the starsâ€¦ if the pirates donâ€™t find you first.

### ðŸ›¸ Encounter the Unknown

* **Rogue Pirates** lurking in asteroid belts, eager to strip your ship for parts.
* **Hostile Aliens** guarding rare resourcesâ€”fight or negotiate your way to survival.
* **Derelict Stations** offering side quests, upgrades, or traps disguised as salvation.

### ðŸ”§ Build. Adapt. Survive.

**Scavenge materials on alien worlds to upgrade your ship**: reinforce hulls, arm plasma cannons, or install stealth drives to evade danger. But bewareâ€”the more cargo you carry, the juicier a target you become.

### ðŸŽ¯ Missions That Matter

**Deliver** critical supplies to war-torn colonies, **smuggle** contraband for shadowy syndicates, or **uncover** ancient relics buried on forgotten worlds. Your choices shape your reputationâ€”and the galaxyâ€™s fate.

### ðŸŒ  Why Stellar Voyager Stands Out

* **Strategic Depth**: A blend of FTL-style resource management and No Manâ€™s Sky-inspired exploration.
* **Pixel Art Majesty**: Elite-inspired retro-styled visuals bring vibrant alien worlds and gritty space battles to life.
* **Endless Replayability**: With procedurally generated galaxies, no two playthroughs are the same.

**ðŸš¨ Warning:** Side effects may include sleepless nights, an obsession with fuel efficiency, and the sudden urge to name your pet after a constellation. Play responsibly.
